## Contributing

### How to prepare the development environment

1. Clone the repository.

   ```bash
   git clone {{cookiecutter.github_host}}/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd {{cookiecutter.repo_name}}
   ```

3. Install [_poetry_](https://python-poetry.org/) _package and dependency manager_.
Follow the [poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
Chose the method that is more convenient to you, for example:

   ```bash
   curl -sSL\
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py \
      | python -
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment (managed by _poetry_) with the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

5. Enter the virtual environment.

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

### How to check code quality

1. Prepare the development environment, as described in
[**How to prepare the development environment**](#how-to-prepare-the-development-environment).

2. Run [_nox_](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/):

   - all checks:

     ```bash
     nox
     ```

   - only linting, using [_pre-commit_](https://pre-commit.com/), with:

     ```bash
     nox -s lint
     ```

   - only tests, using [_pytest_](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) and [_pytest-cov_](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):

     ```bash
     nox -s tests
     ```
